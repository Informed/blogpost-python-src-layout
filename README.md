## Contributing

The article and code attempts to show modern best practices. But who knows what
"Best Practices" really are. This is my best guess based on experience and
reading a wide variety of code and documents.

There are many folks who have more experience and I'm sure more opinions.

Constructive feedback, changes, suggestions, details and/or corrections are
welcome.

Pull requests are welcome. Or just open an issue to discuss what your inputs or
